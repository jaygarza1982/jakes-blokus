# Jake's Blokus

This project aims to emulate the board game Blokus.

## Goals

This project has the following goals:

*   **Piece Placement Logic (Complete):**  The game correctly enforces Blokus placement rules, ensuring pieces are placed legally, touching at least one corner of a previously placed piece of the same color, and not overlapping other pieces (including those of the same color). Currently, an honor system is in place for players taking turns :)
* **Piece Rotations (Complete):**  Players should be able to rotate selected pieces before confirming a placement.

*   **Scoreboard (Complete):** The game accurately calculates and displays the score for each player throughout the duration of the game, based on the number of squares covered by their pieces.

*   **Player Name and Color Customization (Complete):** Players can customize their names and choose their preferred color before starting the game.
*   **Game Server (Work in Progress):**  A game server is being developed to allow for multiplayer games over a network.  This feature is still under development.
